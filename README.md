# Your own channel

A simple Apple TV 4 Template to create your own live TV channel pretty easilly.
1) A free Apple Developer account
2) You will need a Mac running the latest version of Xcode & OSX
3) You will need a live TV or radio source (format: m3u8). You should test the link with VLC to make sure it's working
4) An Apple TV 4th generation (the new one)
5) A USB-C cable to sideload your channel

Template is by default using the NASA TV channel. You just need to add your own channels in the **tvstreams.json** file. Check if your json file is valid.
